# 🔍 Filterable Product Table (Thinking in React)
This project is an interactive product inventory table built with React. It allows a user to search for products and filter them based on whether they are in stock.

This is the classic "Thinking in React" exercise, designed to demonstrate the core concepts of component-based architecture and state management.

# ✨ Features
Dynamic Search: Filter the product list in real-time as the user types in the search bar.

Stock Filtering: A checkbox to show only products that are currently in stock.

Conditional Styling: Out-of-stock products are highlighted in red.

Grouped Data: Products are automatically grouped by category (e.g., "Fruits", "Vegetables").
